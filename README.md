# üìÇ My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio** ‚Äî a collection of projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and building interactive applications.  

Each project includes:
- A well-documented **Jupyter Notebook** with exploratory data analysis and modeling.  
- A **Streamlit app** (when applicable) for interactive exploration.  
- A **README** describing the problem, methodology, and results.

### 2. [Workforce Diversity Clustering](./workforce-diversity-clustering)
Unsupervised learning project clustering workforce diversity data to uncover hidden groupings and representation patterns.  
- Focus: Clustering, visualization, actionable HR insights.  

### 3. [Airbnb Market Gap Analysis](./airbnb-market-gap-analysis)
Analysis of **Airbnb listings in Dublin** to uncover demand‚Äìsupply gaps across neighborhoods, property types, and price bands.  
- Focus: Exploratory data analysis, visualization, Streamlit dashboard.  

### 4. [Customer Churn Prediction](./customer-churn-prediction)
A machine learning pipeline predicting customer churn based on behavioral and demographic data.
